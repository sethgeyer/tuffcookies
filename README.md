I am developing an electronic version of a card game created by me and my 9 year old nephew.  The game is called "Tuff Cookies".  The game is played with two standard decks of playing cards and 36 action cards (although the actual number of cards to use is evolving).

At its core, Tuff Cookies is a simple guessing game of high/low. The dealer flips a card. The player guesses whether the next card will be higher or lower. Guess right, win cards. Guess wrong, lose cards and lose your turn. Built into the game (via the Action Cards) are several other opportunities to win/lose cards and gain a turn/lose a turn (as described on the Action Card). The game is over once the dealer has dealt all of the cards. The player with the biggest stack of cards at the end of the game wins.



Play begins in a clockwise direction and starts w/ the player sitting to the dealer's left. The dealer places a card face­up in the middle of the playing table. (The cards placed here are known as the “cards­-in­-play”.) The player guesses whether the next card will be higher or lower. The dealer flips over the next card. There are four possible outcomes:

a. If the player guesses correctly, the player keeps his turn and guesses whether the next card will be higher or lower.

b. If the next card is the same (aka: neither higher nor lower), the player loses his turn and the next player must guess
whether the next card will be higher or lower.

c. If the next card is an Action Card, play will be momentarily paused while the action (as identified on the Action Card) is
taken. Since Action Cards do not have a numeric value the dealer will need to flip another card to determine whether
the player's high/low guess is accurate.

d. If the player guesses incorrectly, the player loses his turn and the cards­in­play are awarded to the individual to the
right/left* of the player and the dealer moves on to the next player.

*When play is moving in a clockwise direction, cards are awarded to the individual to the player’s right; going counter­clockwise,
cards are awarded to the individual to the player’s left. Once there are at least 4 numbered cards in play (this includes face cards), the current player may choose to “freeze”. The player will be awarded the cards­-in-­play and the dealer will move on to the next player.
